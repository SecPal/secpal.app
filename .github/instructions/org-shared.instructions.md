# secpal.app Runtime Overlay

The historical filename `org-shared.instructions.md` is retained for continuity.
At runtime, this file now acts as the repo-local overlay for the `secpal.app` repository.

- Treat `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in this repo as the authoritative runtime baseline.
- Do not rely on cross-repo inheritance, comments, or external config files being loaded.
- Enforce SecPal core rules while editing any file: fail fast, no bypass, one topic per change, immediate issue creation for out-of-scope findings, and `CHANGELOG.md` updates for real changes.
- Use only `secpal.app` and `secpal.dev`.
- Keep changes repo-local, minimal, and consistent with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and static-site conventions.
